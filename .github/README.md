Yet another anti-bullshit filter list.

## About the project

The overall goal of the project is to block ads and reduce traffic from the domains and sites You visit.
The term "advertising" is not defined in this project, because apart from the obvious advertising, I also block banners and tips that I think create useless traffic.

My list is not limited to any region. However, I speak Russian and English and my focus is mainly on these regions.
